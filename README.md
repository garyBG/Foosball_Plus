# Foosball_Plus WebGL Build

## Description
Codebase for Unity Foosball Game Project. Operates under standard foosball game rules where two players face off on a small game-board with sticks and paddles attempting to score on their opponent's goal. Game integrates full multiplayer (listen-server architecture) with custom serialization for most game objects. Game was created to explore graphics and custom shader scripting in UnityLang. WebGL build code can be found under the repository of the same name at garyBG/Foosball_Plus_WebGL. Under the guidance of Prof. Kelvin Sung in UWB's CSS 451 Graphics course.
